# Profile Picture Instructions

To add your profile picture to the portfolio website:

1. Add your profile picture to this directory and name it `profile.jpg`
2. Make sure your image is:
   - High quality (at least 800x800 pixels)
   - Square in aspect ratio
   - Professional looking
   - In JPG or PNG format

If you don't have a profile picture yet, you can use a placeholder image service like:
- https://placehold.co/800x800/1F2937/E5E7EB?text=Your+Name
- https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=Your+Name&background=8B5CF6&color=fff&size=800

Replace "Your Name" with your actual name in the URL above.
